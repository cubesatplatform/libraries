Command for streaming is stream(123.jpg,0+), if you dont have photos from last time, you can find commamds for taking photo in transmitter.ino, at the end of the file. 
As it's streaming you can see which chunks are received. At the end of streaming, there will be acknowledgement message, which on receiver will look like "<messageid> A <list of chunks not received>". 
That list will most likely be empty, you can maybe force lost packets by removing antenna from receiver 
(I'm not sure for that if comms are close to each other, i connected radios with jumpers and disconnected i think dio1 to test missing packets).

for individual chunk its stream(123.jpg,456) (here for chunk number 456). there is no single command for streaming all miising chuncks
